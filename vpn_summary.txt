A VPN (Virtual Private Network) creates an encrypted tunnel from your device to a VPN server. Your ISP and people on the local network can see you’re connected to a VPN, but can’t see which sites you visit; websites see the VPN server’s IP, not yours.

VPN benefits & limitations

Benefits

1) Encrypts device-to-VPN traffic: protects you on public Wi-Fi from local eavesdroppers/rogue APs.

2) Masks your IP/location: websites and services see the VPN server’s IP, improving privacy and reducing tracking tied to your home IP.

3) Prevents ISP-level snooping: your ISP can see you’re connected to a VPN, not which sites you visit.

4) Bypasses some geo-restrictions/censorship: depending on provider and site blocks.

Limitations

1) Not total anonymity: the VPN provider can technically see your exit traffic; you must trust them. Use reputable providers and stick to HTTPS.

2) Performance trade-offs: higher latency, lower speed—especially on congested/remote servers or free tiers.

3) Service blocking: some sites block known VPN IPs; banking apps may flag VPNs.

4) Leaks/misconfig: WebRTC, IPv6, or DNS misconfigurations can expose your real IP if protections aren’t enabled.

5) Legal/ToS boundaries: lawful use only; some activities (e.g., certain P2P) may violate policies or laws in your jurisdiction.
